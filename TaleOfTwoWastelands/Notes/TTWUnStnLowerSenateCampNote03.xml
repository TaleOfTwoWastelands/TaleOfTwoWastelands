    <Text Tag="TNAM">Rumors started spreading that we were killing the sick and the old to save food for ourselves. The truth is we don't have any. Food - we ran out three days ago and just haven't told them, for fear this would happen. We have lost control.

They marched on us before nightfall and demanded to be let beyond the perimeter. Hunger is a strong motivator. I heard the shot, and then we returned fire. Corporal Bradley was killed defending his post. One of them had found a pistol. 

We killed two men and one woman. The rest were dispersed with tear-gas. It was the same man that had been caught sneaking into the camp before. He had lost all of his hair.

We are waiting now for them to come back. There is a national guard depot to the North. It may not be there anymore. We will try and make for this position in better hopes of making contact with other units.

How will they greet us? How will we greet them?</Text>

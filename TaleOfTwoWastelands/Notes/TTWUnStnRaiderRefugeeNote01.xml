    <Text Tag="TNAM">I told Joey this was a bad idea. I told him it stunk like rotten meat, yeah, but he didn't like that. No one tells Joey what to do. Joey does what he wants, and we follow. 

Yeah, we all follow - except me. Haha! Motherfuckers. I saw them coming before everyone else. First watch and I got the fuck out of there. Slipped out before anyone even knew they were coming - saw my chance and I took it.

It's a goddamn shame, is what it is. A waste of fucking muscle. Way to go, Joey.

I watched them rip open your guts and spill your insides onto the pavement - what a smell that would have been. Fucking ripe. Nasty. </Text>

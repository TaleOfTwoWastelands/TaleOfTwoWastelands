    <Text Tag="TNAM">We have not been able to make contact with any other units in this area.

The survivors have organized themselves and elected a leader. We negotiate with him now to distribute medicine and food. He understands that our supplies are nearly diminished. We all face dehydration and starvation. The first stages of radiation poisoning are showing now. Some are showing acute symptoms while others seem completely unaffected.

Most of the survivors had been inside. They had been lucky enough to be in buildings that didn't collapse in rooms without windows or basements that shielded against the firestorm. The air is sucked out of your lungs. The fires burn so hot, consuming so much oxygen that people are pulled into them with the rushing wind. Parts of the city are still burning, far off in the distance. 

Funny - it's completely silent. </Text>

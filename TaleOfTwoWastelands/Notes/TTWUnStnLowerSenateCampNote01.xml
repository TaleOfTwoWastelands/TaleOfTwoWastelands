    <Text Tag="TNAM">The survivor population continues to become more agitated. A group of three men were caught trying to sneak inside of the perimeter last night. They were arrested and escorted away without further incident, except for waking up the rest of the camp. I think we will see them again.

We have to keep order. Just hold out until we can make contact with other units. Radiation sickness takes time. A woman was complaining of incessant itching all over her body. Her shirt had melted into the skin of her back. It was impossible to remove. There are so many bodies. We have to burn them to prevent disease from spreading. </Text>

    <Name Tag="FULL">Letter from Dad</Name>
    <Type Tag="DATA">Text</Type>
    <Text Tag="TNAM">How are you doing sport?

I heard about what happened at Vault 101. I hope you're OK.

Moira in Megaton said that she saw you headed West. Or someone who looks like you anyway.

I don't know if this letter will ever reach you, but I paid a lot of caps to get several caravan drivers to take copies west.

I could use your help with a project of mine. If you can, come see me in DC.
